# Shuttle-Tracking-Device-
In this project, we will learn about how to make a GPS &amp; GSM Based Vehicle Tracking System using Arduino. The vehicle tracking system will send you the location to your mobile phone along with the Google map coordinate. You can request the location at any time &amp; view the location on Google Maps installed on your mobile phone.
